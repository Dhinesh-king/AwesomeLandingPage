            <p class="bg-primary">Do you know the importance of the number 256? Not everyone understands that it’s the building block of so much in our everyday lives. The number 256 is the number of distinct values that can be represented with a byte, a value well-known to programmers. Not only is it a special number, but this year it’s a special day - the 256th day of this year kicks off a week you won’t want to miss.</p>
            <p>From September 13 – 17, Cognizant will host its annual Programmers’ Week. The week long event is designed specifically for people like YOU - global developers and software engineers who can share and benefit from invaluable professional development, training, and new technology insights and ideas.</p>
